- Warface Logs (Game.log and LogBackups folder must exists)

- Press "Analyze" button.
- Wait operation complete.
- You will see how many times your game loaded that map, time avg, and max time your game took loading the map. 

### Notes
This software does not inject anything to game, neither modify anything in game or game folder!
This just read game logs and extract information inside them.
